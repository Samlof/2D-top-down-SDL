### How do I get set up? ###
SDL2-2.0.4 and glew-2.0.0 required. By default in C:/cpplibraries, change it if necessary. Copy dlls into project folder.

This is a Rimworld style demo I put my hand into for a few weeks.

In the end this project turned out into a mess, but I'll still keep it in here for myself.
2D drawing, camera and zooming is done. Entity prototypes and simple job manager. Right now there's a wheat field growing, a character that will path there, water them and harvest them. I don't remember whether hauling jobs and stockpiles worked yet, but I did work on them.
At the end I tried changing from sdl rendering into raw opengl rendering and quit midway.

Overall it was a good learning experience as my first multiple file C++ program. Pointers and destructors are serious business.
